      - I refactored the whole project to make it more modular, and more testable.
      - I changed workflow automation tools from grunt into gulp and later i switch into webpack

      worked on this project as a junior web developer for a startup company called FIMM.

      I was chosen to be responsible of the frontend and to to learn AngularJS which was popular in that time.
