    I was introduced to new concepts and learned a lot working on this project like: scrum, CI, Unit Testing, workflow automation tools.
    The company was always encouraging us to enhance the project and introduce new web technologies and implementing them,for example: 
      - I refactored the whole project to make it more modular, and more testable.
      - I changed workflow automation tools from grunt into gulp and later i switch into webpack
      - I introduced end-to-end unit testing
